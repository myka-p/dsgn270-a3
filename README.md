## Description
For this assignment, I made an ice cream logo for my client who is a desserts shop owner. I used the triangle shape as the cone by inverting it. I then made the ice cream by combining the rectangle and elipse shape. I made the spoon handle with the rectangle shape as well, and positioned it at the back. After that, i optimized the shape using SVG OMG.
